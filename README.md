Library Management System developed as an Android mobile application using Kotlin and the Gradle build system. It is structured as a typical Android Studio project and includes all necessary files to build and run the app, such as build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts, and other Gradle-related files. Inside the app directory, the project contains source code and resources for the mobile app, and it also includes a compiled debug version of the app (app-debug.apk), which can be installed directly on an Android device for testing. The purpose of this app is likely to help users interact with a library systemâ€”such as viewing available books, managing borrow/return actions, or allowing administrators to update book records. The app uses modern Android development practices, and it is ready to be opened and edited in Android Studio. Overall, it is a well-structured Android project focused on providing a mobile solution for managing library operations.
